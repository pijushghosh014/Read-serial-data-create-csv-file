(Python code for reading incoming sensor data from serial port ‘com12’ at 9600 baud and store it in a CSV file.)

The code is working properly.

1. Upload .ino code to the Arduino Board which is connected with PC through Arduino IDE and identify the COM port.
2. After successfully uploaded .ino code, open Python IDE and run the .py code.
3. Stop the python program according to the user requirement.
4. .csv file automatically saves in the folder where you save the python file earlier.
